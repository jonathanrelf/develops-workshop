# Devel-Ops Workshop

Welcome to the Git repository supporting the Devel-Ops talk given by Jonathan Relf. 

Start by cloning this Git repository to your computer. 

There are two exercises - attempt one

## Packer
This exercise will show you how we can take an installation ISO for Ubuntu Server and create a bootable image. The *packer* directory contains files that will help Packer 

## Vagrant
This exercise will show you how we can take a bootable image and customise it using provisioners to install additional software as it's brought to life.
